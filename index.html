      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Brianna Dysinger. I am a Computer Science major at the University of Central Oklahoma. I am passionate about software development and enjoy creating projects that solve real-world problems. In my free time, I like to learn new programming languages and frameworks to expand my skill set. Right now, I am focusing on improving my machine learning understanding as it is rapidly growing and has a lot of potential for innovation.
        <br>
        Currently, I am seeking full-time and/or internship opportunities beginning Summer 2025. In the meantime, I am working as an Assistant Reseacher in the UCO Math Department doing data analysis using Python. In fact, I will be presenting my research at the 28th Annual Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics in Janurary 2026.
        <br>
        Feel free to check out my projects page to see some of my work!
